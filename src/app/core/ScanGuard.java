/**
 * The scanner has no idea which QR it just read: the operator does. Shooting the
 * lot into QR 1 and the label into QR 2 registers a pair the portal will never
 * match, and nobody notices until the verification comes back red.
 *
 * When the operator describes the two codes with a regular expression, this
 * catches the inversion BEFORE the pair is queued — and can tell an inversion
 * (both codes known, in the wrong holes) from plain nonsense (a code that fits
 * neither), because the two need different answers: swap the first, stop on the
 * second.
 *
 * Pure logic — no Swing, no robot, fully testable. An empty or invalid pattern
 * is an opinion not given: never a reason to block the line.
